# BIOS
Welcome to my Github. My name is Fragility and I've been in the optimisation space for a good couple of years now. I've helped countless individuals over the years with settings, optimisations, tips, tricks and so on. I'm just passionate about hardware and getting the most out of your system to put it bluntly. So throughout the course of this repo, I'm just going to put forward information that you may or may not know about and more specifically, I'm going to detail what I do on my own personal system for the best performance. If you find this information helpful? Please share it with your friends and let's all get the best performance out of our hardware shall we?

## Prelude

When messing around with your BIOS, sometimes (depending upon what is being changed) your BIOS may not like it. Not everyone will have the same bios or motherboard, not evewryone will have the same IMC within their CPU, not everyone will have good BINS on their hardware and as such, sometimes your BIOS will not like the changes that are being made, so for the most part it's trial and error. Luckily for us and luckily you, this guide is going to focus on settings that are relatively safe and most, if not all motherboards will be able to deal with. 

With that being said, you will be at an advantage if you have a CMOS reset switch on the rear of your motherboard. If you do not, please Google: "How do I reset my motherboard? How do I reset my CMOS?" just in case something goes awry when you are applying these settings and tweaking your RAM timings and CPU offsets.

Finally, I am approaching this guide from the point of view of someone who is technically minded and who is running similar hardware and more specifically, AMD focused. I am on the AM5 platform which is DDR5 specific. If you are not on AM5 or DDR5, this is _NOT_ the guide for you.
