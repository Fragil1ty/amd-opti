# BIOS
Welcome to my Github, my only aim in here is to produce something basic and understandable for the masses in relation to AM5 and more specifically, what I do on my own personal system that just works. I'm not going to go over "what a bios" is, what it does and things of that nature, if you're looking for computer basics, Google is at your disposal. Again, I'm using this as a one-stop-shop for you to find values that may or may not work for you so that you're not spending $$$ on PC optimisations, when in reality, it can all be done for FREE.
