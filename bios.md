Welcome to my Github. My name is Fragility and I've been in the optimisation space for a good couple of years now. I've helped countless individuals over the years with settings, optimisations, tips, tricks and so on. I'm just passionate about computers, hardware and getting the most out of what you have paid for. I don't do this professionally, I believe in opensource and with that in mind throughout the repo, I am going to put forward as much informatioin as humanly possible so that you can get solid performance out of your hardware without having to fork out an arm and a leg for optimisations when in reality, you can do this all in the comfort of your own home with a bit of knowledge and courage.
